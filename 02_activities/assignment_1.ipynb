      "  \"Summary\": \"In the year of our Lord 2025, a most curious phenomenon hath been observed in the realm of business, whereupon the grand investment of $30–40 billion into Generative AI hath yielded but a paltry return for the vast majority of enterprises. A mere 5% hath reaped the bountiful harvest of value, whilst the remainder languish in the doldrums of stagnation, their coffers untouched by the promised riches of AI. This divide, christened the GenAI Divide, doth not arise from the quality of models or the shackles of regulation, but from the very approach of the enterprises themselves. Tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot, though widely adopted, serve primarily to enhance the productivity of individuals, yet fail to impact the profit and loss statements of the organizations. The enterprise-grade systems, custom or vendor-sold, are oft rejected due to their brittle workflows and lack of contextual learning. The report doth reveal that the core barrier to scaling AI is not the infrastructure, nor the regulation, nor the talent, but the very learning of the systems themselves. A select few vendors and buyers, by addressing these limitations, hath achieved progress, demanding customization and evaluating tools based on business outcomes. The highest-performing organizations report savings from reduced BPO spending and improved customer retention, suggesting that learning-capable systems, when targeted at specific processes, can indeed deliver value without the need for grand restructuring. Thus, the path to crossing the GenAI Divide lies in the embrace of adaptive, learning systems, and the forging of strategic partnerships that align with the true needs of the business.\",\n",
